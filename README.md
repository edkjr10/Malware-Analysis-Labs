# Malware-Analysis-Labs
This is a collection of documentation of the Static and Dynamic Analysis performed by Eric King on
a diverse set of sample  malware provided by the IBM Malware Analysis Course.

All samples were designed in a Capture The Flag format.
Completion of analysis is defined by finding the flag of the corresponding sample.

Labs are performed in virtual machines using VWware Workstation and software
installed from the Flare-VM collection.
